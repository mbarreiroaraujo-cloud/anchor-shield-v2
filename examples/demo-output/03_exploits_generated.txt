Generated 3 exploits for Critical/High findings:

[SEM-001] Collateral check ignores existing debt (Critical)
  File: exploits/exploit_sem_001_collateral_check_ignores_exist.py
  Language: Python simulation
  Status: GENERATED

[SEM-002] Withdrawal allows full exit with outstanding borrows (Critical)
  File: exploits/exploit_sem_002_withdrawal_allows_full_exit_wi.py
  Language: Python simulation
  Status: GENERATED

[SEM-003] Integer overflow in interest calculation (High)
  File: exploits/exploit_sem_003_integer_overflow_in_interest_c.py
  Language: Python simulation
  Status: GENERATED

Skipped:
  [SEM-004] Division by zero (Medium) — below Critical/High threshold

All exploits are self-contained Python scripts that:
  1. Model the on-chain state as dataclasses
  2. Implement the vulnerable instruction logic
  3. Execute the attack step by step
  4. Assert concrete outcomes proving the exploit
