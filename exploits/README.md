# Bankrun Exploits

Each `.ts` file is a self-contained bankrun exploit that loads a compiled
SBF binary and proves a vulnerability on the Solana runtime.

## Run any exploit

```bash
npm install
npx ts-node bankrun_exploit_tictactoe_001_inverted_constraint.ts
```

## Binaries

The `.so` files here are copies from `real-world-targets/*/` for bankrun convenience.
Canonical source code and binaries live in `real-world-targets/<program>/`.

## Execution logs

Each `*_execution.log` is verbatim stdout/stderr from running the exploit.
These are unedited evidence files.

## Legacy

Python simulations in `legacy/` were replaced by bankrun TypeScript exploits.
